## Overview

Can **music actually change your physical performance** — even when everything else is held constant?

To answer this, we designed a controlled experiment using a  
**Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)** where participants performed a strength task  
under **five different music genres**:

🎻 Classical  🎧 Pop  🎸 Rock  🎷 Jazz  🎤 Hip-hop

Each participant experienced *every* genre, allowing us to isolate the *pure effect of music*  
on physical performance while blocking for age differences.

This project explores whether the rhythm, intensity, or emotional tone of music  
can meaningfully improve (or impair) measurable strength output.

## Key Findings at a Glance

### 🎵 1. Yes — Music *does* influence physical performance  
Our ANOVA results showed a **statistically significant** difference in mean performance across genres.  
Not all music is equal — some genres consistently boosted reps, others held people back.

### 👥 2. Age matters too  
Age group (used as a blocking factor) was also significant.  
That means different age ranges responded differently to the same music —  
a fascinating interaction that the full report explores in detail.

### ⬆ 3. Which genres performed best?  
Tukey HSD pairwise tests revealed surprising contrasts.  
Some music types that participants *expected* to be energizing… were not.  
Others quietly outperformed the rest.

(Full rankings and statistical comparisons are in the PDF!)

### 📈 4. Strong model diagnostics  
Our RCBD model passed all major assumption checks:

- Residuals were approximately normal  
- Variance was stable across treatments  
- No signs of influential outliers  

This means the conclusions are statistically reliable — not noise.

## Why you might want to read the full report

The complete PDF answers questions like:

- Which **specific** genre produced the highest mean performance?  
- How large were the differences? Small? Moderate? Dramatic?  
- Did older and younger participants react to music in the same way?  
- Were the results driven by rhythm, intensity, or something else?  
- How certain are we statistically — what do the confidence intervals say?  

It also includes:

- Full ANOVA tables  
- Tukey HSD comparison plots  
- Diagnostic visuals (Residual plots, Q-Q plots, etc.)  
- Detailed interpretation + limitations  
- Discussion about psychological + physiological explanations  

This is not just a stats report — it's a surprising story about how humans respond to sound.
