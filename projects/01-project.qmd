## Overview

A statistical modeling project predicting **daily wind speed** in Szeged, Hungary\
using four meteorological variables (Temperature, Humidity, Visibility, Pressure)\
from **10 years of daily weather data (2006–2016)**.

The goal was to build, compare, and interpret multiple linear regression models\
and determine which weather factors significantly influence wind speed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Insights (Preview)

-   Humidity and Pressure were strong, statistically significant predictors.\
-   Visibility showed **no significance** in predicting wind speed.\
-   The final model explained **18% of wind speed variation** (R² = 0.18).\
-   Diagnostic checks confirmed:
    -   mostly normal residuals\
    -   mild heteroscedasticity\
    -   no influential outliers\
    -   no multicollinearity (VIF \< 2)

This summary highlights only the main findings —\
the full modeling process, diagnostics, and detailed interpretation\
are included in the complete PDF report.
