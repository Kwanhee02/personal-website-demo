## Overview

Using demographic, economic, and population composition data from the **U.S. Census**,  
this project predicts **whether each U.S. county voted for Biden or Trump in 2020**.  
We focused on building clean preprocessing pipelines and comparing several  
machine-learning models to find the most reliable classifier.

## Key Insights (Preview)

- Most Census features were **heavily right-skewed**, so we used normalization  
  and, when appropriate, log transformations.
- No single variable clearly separated Biden vs. Trump counties —  
  meaningful patterns only appeared in multivariate models.
- After comparing Logistic Regression, KNN, and XGBoost workflows,  
  **generic XGBoost performed best**, achieving **ROC-AUC ≈ 0.973**  
  with stable cross-validation.
- Final test accuracy was about **0.944**, while training accuracy was **1.000**,  
  revealing overfitting that we discuss in the report.
