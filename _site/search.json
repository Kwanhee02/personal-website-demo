Yes — Music does influence physical performance\nOur ANOVA results showed a statistically significant difference in mean performance across genres.\nNot all music is equal — some genres consistently boosted reps, others held people back.\n\n\n👥 2. Age matters too\nAge group (used as a blocking factor) was also significant.\nThat means different age ranges responded differently to the same music —\na fascinating interaction that the full report explores in detail.\n\n\n⬆ 3. Which genres performed best?\nTukey HSD pairwise tests revealed surprising contrasts.\nSome music types that participants expected to be energizing… were not.\nOthers quietly outperformed the rest.\n(Full rankings and statistical comparisons are in the PDF!)\n\n\n📈 4. Strong model diagnostics\nOur RCBD model passed all major assumption checks:\n\nResiduals were approximately normal\n\nVariance was stable across treatments\n\nNo signs of influential outliers\n\nThis means the conclusions are statistically reliable — not noise."
